# gendertracker
# Project Title

[gendertracker] scans a user-inputted body of text for adjectives that skew stereotypically male or female and offers users alternative, more gender-neutral phrases to use. For example, "aggressive" typically skews male whereas "bossy" typically skews female ([see Bolukbasi et. al, 2016 for more information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520)). Our goal in developing this web application is to neutralize gender bias for word embeddings in natural language, ensuring more fair hiring practices that do not perpetuate gender stereotypes.
